# Booty
### The BOT you can call on!

Booty is a simple moderation Bot
Its main purpose is to remove inactive people 
from your server.


To do so it tracks the latest activity of each member.
When joining it automatically assigns one timestamp to each
user representing the current moment.
This timestamp is overwritten whenever someone:
* sends a text message
* joins a voice channel
* uses reaction emojis

The bot will not know what the last activity was nor any of
its content. It also removes stored data when the bot or 
a member is removed or leaves the server.

As owner or team member with at least kick permissions you
can select how many days inactivity count as being inactive, 
exclude people from kicks and pull an overview who would be 
kicked if /kick is used.

More files and details will be added over time
